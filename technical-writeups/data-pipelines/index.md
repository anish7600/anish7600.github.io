# Data Pipelines: Batch vs Stream

Modern data-driven systems rely heavily on efficient data pipelines to extract, process, and move data from source systems to analytical platforms. Two primary paradigms exist in data processing: **Batch Processing** and **Stream Processing**. Choosing between them depends on latency needs, data volume, complexity, and infrastructure.

## 1. Overview

| Aspect          | Batch Processing               | Stream Processing                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Processing Mode | Periodic (e.g., hourly, daily) | Continuous (real-time or near real-time)     |
| Latency         | Minutes to hours               | Milliseconds to seconds                      |
| Data Size       | Large volumes at once          | Small pieces, continuously flowing           |
| Use Cases       | ETL, reporting, backups        | Fraud detection, monitoring, alerting        |
| Examples        | Hadoop, AWS Glue, Apache Nifi  | Kafka Streams, Apache Flink, Spark Streaming |

## 2. Batch Processing

### How It Works:

Data is collected over a period, stored, and then processed as a group (batch). For example, processing all sales transactions at the end of the day.

### Architecture:

* **Ingestion**: Data is read from logs/files (e.g., S3, HDFS).
* **Transformation**: Performed using frameworks like Apache Spark or MapReduce.
* **Storage/Output**: Results are stored in databases, warehouses (like Snowflake, Redshift).

### Pros:

* Efficient for large volumes.
* Simpler to implement and maintain.
* Ideal for data analysis that isn’t time-sensitive.

### Cons:

* Not suitable for real-time needs.
* Delayed data visibility and insights.

## 3. Stream Processing

### How It Works:

Processes data as it arrives, record by record. Useful in scenarios where immediate decisions or actions are needed (e.g., processing sensor data or financial transactions).

### Architecture:

* **Source**: Kafka, Pulsar, or a real-time database.
* **Processor**: Spark Streaming, Flink, or Apache Beam.
* **Sink**: Real-time dashboards, databases, or alerts.

### Pros:

* Real-time analytics and actions.
* Enables dynamic dashboards and live user feedback.
* Faster anomaly or fraud detection.

### Cons:

* More complex architecture.
* Requires state management and fault tolerance.
* Debugging and testing can be harder.

## 4. Key Design Considerations

| Criteria                | Description                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Latency**             | Real-time systems need low latency; batch can tolerate delay.                |
| **Scalability**         | Both systems should scale, but streaming needs fine-grained resource tuning. |
| **Fault Tolerance**     | Stream processors must handle retries, checkpoints, and state recovery.      |
| **Ordering Guarantees** | Stream processing might face out-of-order data; batch is more deterministic. |
| **Throughput**          | Batch systems can handle more data in bulk; streaming needs to be always on. |

## 5. When to Use What?

### Use **Batch Processing** When:

* Daily reporting or ETL jobs.
* Historical data processing.
* Data can tolerate delay.

### Use **Stream Processing** When:

* Monitoring or alerting systems.
* User-facing systems needing real-time updates.
* Time-critical analytics (e.g., fraud detection).

## 6. Hybrid Pipelines: Lambda & Kappa Architectures

* **Lambda Architecture**: Combines batch and stream processing for fault tolerance and real-time analytics.
* **Kappa Architecture**: Simplifies by using stream processing for all workloads with replayable logs (e.g., Kafka).

## Conclusion

Both batch and stream processing have unique strengths. Batch is robust and simple for offline analytics, while stream processing is essential for real-time applications. Often, modern data architectures blend both to maximize performance and insight delivery.
