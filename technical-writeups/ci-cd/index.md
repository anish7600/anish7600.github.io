# CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins, GitLab, and GitHub Actions

Modern software development practices prioritize speed, reliability, and consistency. Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD) help teams automate testing, building, and deployment of applications. Let‚Äôs explore how Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, and GitHub Actions enable this automation.

---

## üöÄ What is CI/CD?

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automatically integrating code changes into a shared repository and running tests to detect issues early.
* **Continuous Delivery (CD):** Automating the release of validated code to staging or production.
* **Continuous Deployment:** Extends delivery to automatically release every validated change to production.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Jenkins

### Overview:

* **Language:** Java-based
* **Setup:** Self-hosted, requires configuration
* **Flexibility:** Highly customizable with plugins

### Example Pipeline (Jenkinsfile):

```groovy
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git 'https://github.com/user/repo.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        sh './build.sh'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        sh './run-tests.sh'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        sh './deploy.sh'
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Pros:

* Highly extensible (1500+ plugins)
* Mature and widely adopted

### Cons:

* Complex setup and maintenance
* UI/UX not as modern

---

## üß™ GitLab CI/CD

### Overview:

* **Tightly integrated** with GitLab repos
* **GitOps-style** pipelines via `.gitlab-ci.yml`
* **Auto DevOps** support

### Example `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

```yaml
stages:
  - build
  - test
  - deploy

build_job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - npm install

test_job:
  stage: test
  script:
    - npm test

deploy_job:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - ./deploy.sh
  only:
    - main
```

### Pros:

* All-in-one platform
* Visual pipeline editor
* Built-in container registry

### Cons:

* GitLab-specific (limited if using GitHub)

---

## ‚ö° GitHub Actions

### Overview:

* Integrated into **GitHub**
* Define workflows using YAML in `.github/workflows/`

### Example Workflow:

```yaml
name: CI Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm test
```

### Pros:

* Native GitHub integration
* Marketplace for reusable actions
* Easier setup for open-source projects

### Cons:

* Limited flexibility for complex pipelines
* Workflow logs could be more user-friendly

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for CI/CD

* **Fail fast:** Run tests early in the pipeline
* **Parallelization:** Split tests/builds across jobs
* **Artifacts:** Use caching and artifacts between jobs
* **Secrets Management:** Use environment variables or secret stores
* **Rollback Plans:** Automate rollback on failed deployments

## üîö Conclusion

Whether you're a team looking for a fully integrated DevOps platform (GitLab), already invested in GitHub (GitHub Actions), or need a highly customizable solution (Jenkins), choosing the right CI/CD tool hinges on your development workflow, hosting preference, and integration needs.
