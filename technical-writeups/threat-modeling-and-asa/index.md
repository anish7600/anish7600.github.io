# 🔐 Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Analysis: A Technical Overview

## 🔎 Introduction

In today's cybersecurity landscape, understanding *how* attackers might target your systems is just as important as securing them. **Threat Modeling** and **Attack Surface Analysis (ASA)** are two proactive techniques used during software development and security assessments to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.

## 🧠 What is Threat Modeling?

**Threat Modeling** is a structured process for identifying potential threats to a system and developing mitigations to prevent or minimize their impact.

### 🛠️ Key Goals

* Understand what you're building.
* Identify security risks and vulnerabilities.
* Enumerate potential attackers and their goals.
* Prioritize mitigations early in the development lifecycle (Shift-Left Security).

### 🎯 When to Perform Threat Modeling?

* During design phase of software/system development (ideal).
* After major architectural changes.
* Before deployment to production.

## 🧩 Core Components of Threat Modeling

| Component        | Description                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Assets**       | What are we trying to protect? (e.g., PII, credentials, IP)                |
| **Threats**      | What can go wrong? (e.g., SQLi, XSS, privilege escalation)                 |
| **Attackers**    | Who might try to attack the system? (e.g., insiders, hackers, competitors) |
| **Entry Points** | How might an attacker gain access? (e.g., APIs, UI, open ports)            |
| **Mitigations**  | How can we reduce the risk? (e.g., validation, authN, monitoring)          |

## ⚙️ Common Threat Modeling Methodologies

### 1. **STRIDE (by Microsoft)**

Used to identify typical security threats:

| Category                   | Description                             |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| S – Spoofing               | Impersonating something or someone else |
| T – Tampering              | Unauthorized changes to data            |
| R – Repudiation            | Denial of actions                       |
| I – Information Disclosure | Leaking sensitive information           |
| D – Denial of Service      | Making resources unavailable            |
| E – Elevation of Privilege | Gaining higher access than permitted    |

### 2. **PASTA** *(Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis)*

A risk-centric approach focusing on attacker motivations and likelihood.

### 3. **LINDDUN** *(Privacy threat modeling)*

Focuses on identifying privacy-related threats like data linkability and unawareness.

## 🧱 What is Attack Surface Analysis?

**Attack Surface Analysis (ASA)** involves identifying all the points where an attacker could interact with your system — also known as **attack vectors**.

> Think of ASA as mapping the doors and windows into your digital "house."

### 🎯 Goals of ASA

* Minimize entry points.
* Harden each entry point with security controls.
* Continuously monitor for surface changes (e.g., via CI/CD pipelines).

## 🔍 Types of Attack Surfaces

| Category         | Examples                                                 |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Network**      | Open ports, exposed services (e.g., SSH, HTTP, DB)       |
| **Software/API** | REST endpoints, SOAP APIs, RPC interfaces                |
| **Human/Social** | Phishing vectors, insider threats, misconfigurations     |
| **Physical**     | USB ports, local consoles, building access               |
| **Third-party**  | Dependencies, SaaS integrations, cloud misconfigurations |

| Tool                           | Purpose                            |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool | STRIDE-based diagrams              |
| OWASP Threat Dragon            | Open-source threat modeling tool   |
| attack surface analyzer        | Microsoft's ASA CLI/GUI tool       |
| Burp Suite/ZAP                 | Active web/API surface discovery   |
| Nmap                           | Network port scanning              |
| Shodan                         | External internet-exposed surfaces |

## 🌐 Real-World Example: Web Application

**Scenario**: An online banking portal.

### Threat Modeling

* **Assets**: User credentials, account info, transaction history.
* **Attackers**: Hacktivists, cybercriminals, insider threats.
* **Threats (STRIDE)**:

  * **Spoofing**: Attacker mimics login page (phishing).
  * **Tampering**: Modify transaction amounts via intercepted API call.
  * **Repudiation**: Malicious user denies a fraudulent transaction.
  * **Information Disclosure**: Improper access control leaks PII.
  * **DoS**: Flood login page with fake requests.
  * **EoP**: Gain admin access via insecure cookies.

### Attack Surface Analysis

* **External attack surface**:

  * HTTPS Web UI
  * RESTful API endpoints
  * Email communication
* **Internal attack surface**:

  * Admin dashboard
  * Database connections
* **Minimization strategies**:

  * Limit open ports (close SSH on public interface).
  * Harden API with authentication and rate-limiting.
  * Remove unused endpoints.

## 📉 Threat Modeling vs Attack Surface Analysis

| Aspect       | Threat Modeling                            | Attack Surface Analysis                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Focus**    | Identifying threats                        | Identifying entry points                  |
| **Goal**     | Understand attacker motivations & defenses | Map and reduce exposure                   |
| **Timing**   | During design or review phase              | During design and during/after deployment |
| **Approach** | Conceptual + diagram-based                 | Empirical + discovery                     |

## 🔁 Best Practices

* Perform both threat modeling and ASA **early and often**.
* Integrate into **SDLC** (Shift-left security).
* **Document** findings and update models after each major change.
* Use **automated scanners** alongside manual reviews.
* Involve **cross-functional teams**: devs, testers, security, ops.

## 🧩 Conclusion

Threat Modeling and Attack Surface Analysis are complementary practices that together build a resilient security posture. By identifying *what can go wrong* and *how attackers could break in*, teams can proactively defend systems — reducing costly vulnerabilities and protecting critical assets.

> In the battle for secure systems, knowing your enemy—and how they might attack—is half the fight.
