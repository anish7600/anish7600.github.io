# MLOps: Versioning Models and Automating Deployment

MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) bridges the gap between data science and operations, bringing DevOps principles into the lifecycle of machine learning models. A critical component of MLOps is **model versioning** and **automated deployment**, ensuring models are reproducible, traceable, and scalable in production environments.

---

##  Why Versioning Models?

Just as source code needs version control, so do ML models — but models are more complex. You must track:

* **Model weights and architecture**
* **Training datasets and preprocessing steps**
* **Hyperparameters**
* **Training code and environment**
* **Metrics and evaluation results**

###  Tools for Model Versioning

| Tool                       | Purpose                                |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Git                        | Code versioning                        |
| DVC (Data Version Control) | Data and model artifact versioning     |
| MLflow                     | Experiment tracking and model registry |
| Weights & Biases           | Logging and tracking training runs     |
| HuggingFace Hub            | Sharing pre-trained models             |

**Example with DVC:**

```bash
dvc init
dvc add model.pkl
git add model.pkl.dvc
git commit -m "Add trained model v1"
```

##  Automating Deployment of Models

Automating deployment is about continuously delivering and updating models in production with minimal manual intervention.

###  Packaging the Model

Models are usually packaged as:

* Python packages (`setup.py`)
* REST APIs using Flask/FastAPI
* Docker containers for portability

###  CI/CD Pipeline for ML (MLOps)

```plaintext
[Git Push]  [CI: Test + Build]  [Model Registry Push]  
[CD: Deploy to Staging/Production]  [Monitor and Retrain]
```

**Popular CI/CD Tools for MLOps:**

* **GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:** Trigger pipelines on code/model changes
* **Jenkins:** Custom automation jobs
* **Seldon Core / KFServing:** Deploy models on Kubernetes
* **Argo Workflows:** For ML workflows in Kubernetes

### ️ Deployment Patterns

* **Batch Inference**: Pre-compute predictions and store
* **Online Inference**: Serve predictions in real-time via API
* **Streaming Inference**: Combine with Kafka/Spark for real-time processing

---

##  Example: MLflow Model Deployment (REST API)

```bash
mlflow models serve -m runs:/<run-id>/model -p 5000
```

This exposes your model as a REST API with `/predict` endpoint.

---

##  Monitoring and Retraining

Once deployed, models must be:

* **Monitored** for performance drift (e.g., accuracy drop)
* **Logged** for input/output
* **Re-trained** on fresh data via automated workflows

Tools: Prometheus + Grafana, EvidentlyAI, A/B Testing pipelines

---

##  Version Control Best Practices

* Use semantic versioning (`v1.0.0`)
* Save metadata: metrics, git hash, environment (conda/pip)
* Store models in a registry (e.g., MLflow Registry, S3, or HuggingFace)

##  Summary

| Step                  | Tool/Concept            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Code Versioning       | Git                     |
| Data/Model Versioning | DVC, MLflow             |
| Packaging             | Docker, FastAPI         |
| CI/CD                 | GitHub Actions, Jenkins |
| Deployment            | Kubernetes, Seldon Core |
| Monitoring            | Prometheus, Grafana     |

MLOps enables reliable, repeatable, and scalable ML pipelines. Versioning and automated deployment are foundational for ensuring that ML models remain robust and accountable in production.
