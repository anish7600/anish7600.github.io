## Using Pytest Fixtures for Layered Test Abstractions

In large and complex Python test suites, **Pytest fixtures** help abstract test setup and teardown logic in a reusable and composable way. This improves maintainability and readability while enforcing good separation of concerns. In a layered testing architecture (unit → integration → end-to-end), fixtures allow you to build from minimal mocks to fully wired systems progressively.

---

###  What Are Pytest Fixtures?

A fixture is a function decorated with `@pytest.fixture` that provides data, state, or setup code to your tests. You can:

* Scope them (`function`, `module`, `class`, `session`)
* Chain them (fixture can use other fixtures)
* Parameterize them (using `@pytest.mark.parametrize`)
* Automatically apply them (using `autouse=True`)

---

###  Layered Fixture Architecture

Let’s illustrate the idea by using a layered test setup for a microservice-based API with database dependencies.

#### 1. **Unit Test Layer**

Minimal setup with mocks or stubs.

```python
@pytest.fixture
def mock_db():
    return MagicMock()  # or use pytest-mock's mocker fixture

@pytest.fixture
def service(mock_db):
    return MyService(db=mock_db)
```

Use in test:

```python
def test_add_user(service):
    service.add_user("alice")
    service.db.insert.assert_called_once()
```

---

#### 2. **Integration Test Layer**

Wires real DB or network dependencies (e.g., using test containers or SQLite).

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="module")
def sqlite_db():
    conn = sqlite3.connect(":memory:")
    setup_schema(conn)
    yield conn
    conn.close()

@pytest.fixture
def service(sqlite_db):
    return MyService(db=sqlite_db)
```

Use in test:

```python
def test_add_user_integration(service):
    service.add_user("bob")
    rows = service.db.execute("SELECT * FROM users").fetchall()
    assert len(rows) == 1
```

---

#### 3. **End-to-End (E2E) Layer**

Simulates actual API calls, using real infrastructure (Docker Compose, test server).

```python
@pytest.fixture(scope="session")
def start_test_server():
    proc = subprocess.Popen(["uvicorn", "main:app"])
    time.sleep(2)  # wait for startup
    yield
    proc.terminate()

@pytest.fixture
def api_client():
    return requests.Session()
```

Use in test:

```python
def test_api_register_user(start_test_server, api_client):
    resp = api_client.post("http://localhost:8000/register", json={"name": "charlie"})
    assert resp.status_code == 200
```

---

###  Best Practices

* **Keep fixtures lean and focused** on one responsibility.
* **Avoid shared state** unless using proper teardown or session-scoped resources.
* **Name fixtures descriptively** (`mock_user`, `real_db_conn`, `temp_file_path`).
* Use `autouse=True` cautiously to avoid implicit setups that confuse readers.
* Combine with `pytest-mock`, `pytest-django`, or `pytest-flask` for richer integrations.

---

###  Summary

Layered test abstractions using Pytest fixtures allow you to:

* Start with unit tests using mocks.
* Gradually increase fidelity with integration and E2E setups.
* Compose tests clearly and maintainably.

This aligns well with modern development where test speed, reliability, and clarity are all critical.
