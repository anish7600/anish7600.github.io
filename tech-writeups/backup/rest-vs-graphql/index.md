## REST vs GraphQL: When to Use What

In modern web and mobile application development, APIs are essential for client-server communication. Two dominant API styles are REST and GraphQL. Understanding their differences, strengths, and appropriate use cases is critical for designing scalable, efficient systems.

###  What is REST?

**REST (Representational State Transfer)** is an architectural style for distributed systems, typically using HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE to perform operations on resources identified by URLs.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **Resource-oriented** (e.g., `/users/1`)
* Uses **standard HTTP methods**
* Responses usually in **JSON or XML**
* **Stateless**: each request contains all necessary information
* **Versioned** (e.g., `/v1/users`)

###  What is GraphQL?

**GraphQL** is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries, developed by Facebook. Unlike REST, the client specifies exactly what data it needs.

#### Key Characteristics:

* **Schema-based and strongly typed**
* **Single endpoint** (e.g., `/graphql`)
* Client-defined queries (nested and selective)
* Supports **real-time subscriptions**
* Avoids over-fetching and under-fetching

###  Key Differences

| Feature            | REST                              | GraphQL                                |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Data Fetching**  | Fixed structure                   | Flexible, client-defined               |
| **Endpoints**      | Multiple endpoints                | Single endpoint                        |
| **Over-fetching**  | Common (returns more than needed) | Rare (client asks for specific fields) |
| **Under-fetching** | Requires multiple requests        | Combines data in one query             |
| **Versioning**     | Handled via URI or headers        | Schema evolution without versioning    |
| **Tooling**        | Mature ecosystem, simple to debug | Rich introspection and schema tools    |
| **Caching**        | Easy with HTTP tools              | Requires custom caching strategy       |

###  When to Use REST

Use REST when:

* The API is **simple and CRUD-based**
* You want **easy caching** via HTTP
* Existing tools or clients are REST-optimized
* You need **low complexity** and **broad compatibility**
* You're exposing resources with well-defined URIs

---

###  When to Use GraphQL

Use GraphQL when:

* The client requires **precise control over the data**
* Avoiding **multiple round trips** is important (especially on mobile)
* You're building **rich, evolving frontends** (e.g., dashboards)
* The API is **complex** with nested relationships
* You want **strong typing and introspection** for tooling

### ️ Summary

| Use Case                               | Best Fit |
| -------------------------------------- | -------- |
| Simple CRUD APIs                       | REST     |
| Mobile clients needing efficiency      | GraphQL  |
| Public APIs needing HTTP caching       | REST     |
| APIs with complex data relationships   | GraphQL  |
| Long-lived clients with changing needs | GraphQL  |

---

###  Conclusion

REST and GraphQL serve different needs. REST shines in simplicity, standardization, and compatibility. GraphQL excels in flexibility and efficiency, especially for modern frontend-driven development. Choosing the right one depends on your application’s requirements, data complexity, and development velocity.
